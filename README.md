# RBAC Slicer

Get some kind of summary info for roles deployed into large cluster.
Large clusters can get a very chaotic and huge collection of rbacs.
This tool gathers gerenal summaries of the situation.

This is a demo that is useful, but needs more work.

For example there might be:
- 128 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 MutatingWebhookConfiguration
- 44 apiextensions.k8s.io customresourcedefinitions
